# Onboarding

Focusing on the developer onboarding process into a project is a very important 
step to make a repository popular: no one wants to struggle for hours to setup
an application and start developing on it. 

A streamlined and easy setup process is thus critical to having meaningful 
contributions on an open-source repository.

## Rules of the OFF on-boarding process

The setup steps should be as simple as possible and stick by the following rules:

* **Respect the user's time**: reduce the amount of time needed to setup a project to the least amount possible.
* **Make it easy for non-developers to contribute**: the dev setup should not require a high comprehension of the application at hand.
* **Repeatable and tested developer workflow**: the dev setup should be automated and tested with every pull request to ensure that it does not break accidentally when making changes.

The `make dev` command should work across all repos to streamline the applications setup process.
